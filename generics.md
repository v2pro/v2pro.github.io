# Template Expansion

Generics is more than simple type subsitution. In C++, template specialization evolved into a set of techniques to do compile time calculation, which leads to constexpr added to the language. In D, we have static if, which supports a subset of the D language in the compile time. Even if Go 2.0 starts to support Generics, it will take some time to same level of maturity. Code generation will continue to be a possible solution for a long time. Hand-rolled code generator will have scalability issue, we can support complex logic such as one generic function calling another one. The goal of wombat is to build a large-scale code generation framework, which make complex utility can be reused. The utility can be as simple as compare, max, or as complex as json encoding/decoding.
